alea
====

Alea is a dicebot I'm writing in Common Lisp, because I needed a dicebot and I wanted to learn Common Lisp. At the time of this writing (2014-04-27) it is not ready for actual use.

### Known Deficiencies

* Alea uses SBCL extensions and doesn't even pretend to be portable to other CL implementations.
* Alea cannot be told to join any channels or quit (via in-irc commands)
